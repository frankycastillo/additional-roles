Recki-ct
================

##Instructions
There is no variable specific to this role.
Ansible will try to guess what you use between php-fpm, modphp or the cli,
and will add the configuration accordingly.
It will expect a handler to restart apache or nginx if any of those are installed.
That handler is provided by phansible


Enjoy
